Hi everyone. We've heard that you want to know what we're up to, so we're writing to keep you all up on the latest.

Since we last wrote, we have continued our [governance plan](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/issues/7). Before voting to elect leadership, we decided to [eliminate the single "Project Leader" role](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/pull/9), to align more closely with the way we have worked together in the past. Once that change was made, we held nominations and elections for the [Project Leadership Committee](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/blob/11b92916b5a159cadcf3e4d90dd9506a69a190e7/Gem.coop-Governance.md#5-maintainers).

We are happy to announce that the contributors to [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org/) in the last 12 months have elected the first [gem.coop](https://gem.coop/) [Project Leadership Committee](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/blob/11b92916b5a159cadcf3e4d90dd9506a69a190e7/Gem.coop-Governance.md#3-project-leadership-committee), with members [@martinemde](https://github.com/martinemde), [@indirect](https://github.com/indirect), and [@duckinator](https://github.com/duckinator). Next, we'll be working together to set up the official list of [Maintainers](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/blob/11b92916b5a159cadcf3e4d90dd9506a69a190e7/Gem.coop-Governance.md#5-maintainers), and selecting the [Technical Leadership Committee](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/blob/11b92916b5a159cadcf3e4d90dd9506a69a190e7/Gem.coop-Governance.md#4-technical-steering-committee) from those maintainers.

We are also excited to report that we have finalized a contract with [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) to participate in their [Fast Forward](https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward) program, meaning our [CDN infrastructure is now being donated by Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/products/cdn). Thank you very much to Fastly for their consistent support of open source infrastructure.

With those important start-up items now much farther along, we're looking forward to turning more of our attention and focus to shipping new features. As always, if you're interested in contributing, asking questions, or just hanging out, you're welcome to join the [Bundler Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bundler/shared_invite/zt-3gzoadr40-Uk0Q4jfNWw6938TZpV9Okw) and chat with us in the #gem-coop channel.

Until next time,  
The Gem Cooperative Team
