Over the past few months, a lot has changed. Our team has grown closer together,
the appetite for innovation in Ruby has skyrocketed, and in every part of the
Ruby community we've seen more engagement and collaboration.

Ruby cracked open a little and the community stepped in to fill the gaps.

We're reaching out to let you know that we are all grateful for your support.
We're excited to see what we can make together.

Thank you.

P.S. At SFRuby Conf, Mike Perham (@mperham) announced the [Gem
Fellowship](https://gem.coop/fellowship), a grant partnership between
[gem.coop](https://gem.coop) and [Contributed Systems](https://contribsys.com)
to provide $100,000 in grants for each of the next three years. We can't wait to
see what you build!
