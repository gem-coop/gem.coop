From guest author, Mike Perham (@mperham), creator and maintainer of Sidekiq.

I'm happy to announce the **Gem Fellowship**, a grant partnership with [gem.coop](https://gem.coop), the new open source cooperative in the Ruby community. [Contributed Systems](https://contribsys.com), my company behind Sidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise, is committing to provide $100,000 in grants for each of the next three years. These grants are meant to provide funding to the altruistic people who maintain and improve the open source tools freely available to the Ruby community.
