### Get started 

To use gem cooldowns, change your gem source URL:

```diff
- source "https://gem.coop"
+ source "https://beta.gem.coop/cooldown"
```

### Cooldown period

The gem.coop public cooldown server hides gems until they have been published for 48 hours. If you need a different amount of time, [let's talk](mailto:hello@gem.coop).

### Why use cooldowns?

[We should all be using dependency cooldowns](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns).

### Why did you make this?

Cooldowns are a useful tool to increase security. We wrote more about our reasons in the [cooldowns release announcement](/updates/4#whats-a-cooldown).
