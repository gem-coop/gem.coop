We’re excited to introduce **gem.coop** -- a new server for gems in the Ruby ecosystem.

We aim for fast, simple hosting, that is compatible with Bundler but optimized for the next generation. It’s built for the community by the former maintainers and operators of RubyGems.org.

All gems published to RubyGems.org are available, updated in real time. Get started right now with a simple change to your Gemfile:

```diff
-source "https://rubygems.org"
+source "https://gem.coop"
```

Governance for this project is modeled on Homebrew, with setup assistance from Mike McQuaid, and will be published next week. Everyone from the Ruby community is welcome to contribute and participate.

If you want to follow along with our progress, subscribe to the gem.coop newsletter for monthly updates.

Our goal is to provide fast, community-owned, transparent, sustainable, and secure gem hosting for everyone. We’re launching with support for bundling and installing all public gems, and we’re excited to keep improving.
