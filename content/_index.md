title: "gem.coop"
---

a new server for gems in the [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/) ecosystem, built by the long-time maintainers and operators of [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).

Update your [Gemfile](https://bundler.io/guides/gemfile.html) now, **gem.coop** mirrors RubyGems.org in real time:

```diff
-source "https://rubygems.org"
+source "https://gem.coop"
```

Our vision: fast, secure hosting, built on a sustainable model, supporting next generation tools while remaining compatible with modern [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Subscribe to the **gem.coop newsletter** for updates (every few weeks) from the team.
