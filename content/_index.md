title: "gem.coop"
---

We’re excited to introduce **gem.coop** -- a new server for gems in the [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/) ecosystem.

We aim for fast, simple hosting, that is compatible with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) but optimized for the next generation. It’s built for the community by the former maintainers and operators of [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).

All gems published to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/) are available, updated in real time. Get started right now with a simple change to your [Gemfile](https://bundler.io/guides/gemfile.html):

```diff
-source "https://rubygems.org"
+source "https://gem.coop"
```

If you want to follow along with our progress, subscribe to the gem.coop newsletter for monthly updates.

Our goal is to provide fast, community-owned, transparent, sustainable, and secure gem hosting for everyone. We’re launching with support for bundling and installing all public gems, and we’re excited to keep improving.
